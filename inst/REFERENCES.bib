   abstract = {Biological temperature-dependent rate models based on Arrhenius' and Eyring's equations have been formulated by Johnson & Lewin (1946), Hultin (1955), and Sharpe & DeMichele (1977). The original formulation of Sharpe and DeMichele is poorly suited for non-linear regression. Very high correlations of parameter estimators occassionally make regression with their equation impossible using Marquardt's algorithm (1963).

This analysis describes a new formulation of Sharpe and DeMichele's model that greatly alleviates the non-linear regression problem. It is partly based on Hultin's formulation (1955). Biological and graphical interpretation of the model parameters is discussed. Regression suitability is illustrated with a typical data set. Similar modifications to the equations of Hultin (1955) and Johnson & Lewin (1946) are described.},

   abstract = {The function relating phenotypic sex ratio to incubation temperature in reptiles can vary in a number of ways in addition to simple differences in the temperatures giving 50\% of each sex. This paper offers terminology and definitions for describing these relationships. These definitions accomodate interactions between genetic and environmental effects on sexual differentiation, and variability within populations. The paper also discusses the concept of a sensitive stage/period within incubation during which temperature can affect the direction of sexual differentiation. Thermosensitive period has previously been assessed in a variety of ways. A suggestion for a more general way of defining thermosensitive stage/period is made.},

\usage{
GRTRN_MHmcmc(result = NULL, n.iter = 10000, parametersMCMC = NULL,
  n.chains = 1, n.adapt = 0, thin = 1, trace = FALSE,
  batchSize = sqrt(n.iter), parallel = TRUE, intermediate = NULL,
  filename = "intermediate.Rdata", previous = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{An object obtained after a SearchR fit}

\item{n.iter}{Number of iterations for each step}

\item{parametersMCMC}{A set of parameters used as initial point for searching with information on priors}

\item{n.chains}{Number of replicates}

\item{n.adapt}{Number of iterations before to store outputs}

\item{thin}{Number of iterations between each stored output}

\item{trace}{True or False, shows progress}

\item{batchSize}{Number of observations to include in each batch fo SE estimation}

\item{parallel}{If true, try to use several cores using parallel computing}

\item{intermediate}{Period for saving intermediate result, NULL for no save}

\item{filename}{If intermediate is not NULL, save intermediate result in this file}

\item{previous}{Previous result to be continued. Can be the filename in which intermediate results are saved.}
}
\value{
A list with resultMCMC being mcmc.list object, resultLnL being likelihoods and parametersMCMC being the parameters used
}
\description{
Run the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for data.\cr
The number of iterations is \code{n.iter+n.adapt+1} because the initial likelihood is also displayed.\cr
I recommend that thin=1 because the method to estimate SE uses resampling.\cr
If initial point is maximum likelihood, n.adapt = 0 is a good solution.\cr
To get the SE of the point estimates from \code{result_mcmc <- GRTRN_MHmcmc(result=try)}, use:\cr
\code{result_mcmc$SD}\cr
\code{coda} package is necessary for this function.\cr
The parameters \code{intermediate} and \code{filename} are used to save intermediate results every 'intermediate' iterations (for example 1000). Results are saved in a file named \code{filename}.\cr
The parameter previous is used to indicate the list that has been save using the parameters intermediate and filename. It permits to continue a mcmc search.\cr
These options are used to prevent the consequences of computer crash or if the run is very very long and processes with user limited time.\cr
